### Harvest Reddit Data with Top-Level Comments

This script can be used for harvesting data from the Reddit API. As per Reddit API terms, you must create an account at [reddit.com(http://www.reddit.com) and then [register an app](https://ssl.reddit.com) and get authentication keys first before harvesting data.

In order to run this script, you need to save it to your computer and remember where you saved it. You also need `python` installed on your computer. 

To find out whether you have python, open your command prompt (terminal) and type `python --version`. 


Once you have python installed, download the reddit.py file. Navigate to the folder where the file is installed in your command (terminal) wowindow. 

Example: `cd downloads`

Once in the right folder, type `python reddit.py`. If you have python 3 installed, type `python3 reddit.py`. 

The script will run. Then find `posts.txt` file in the same folder as your `reddit.py` file.
